This is a machine learning project. It is using data on fuel price, exhange rate and oil price to predict the fuel price in advance.

5. When models have been made, test on things like sin(x) vs sin(2x) or 2*sin(x) to test how well they work
6. Maybe the seasonal/weekly trends have to be removed from the data before using the comparisons etc.a
